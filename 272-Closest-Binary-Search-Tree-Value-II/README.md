In-order traverse the binary tree, and binary search the last one that arr[i] <= target.  

Starting from there, two pointers, left and right to expand the result set size to k.  

Space O(n+k) == O(n)   Time O(n + logn + k) == Time O(n)

Note that the follow up is a good question to ask when clarifying the pre-conditions.
