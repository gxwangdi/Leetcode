Basically level order, or width first traversal.  Set a flag to check if this order is done.  Could use a loop or recursion.     

Space O(n), Time O(n)    time limit exceeded.   
=================================================
DFS, and check min height and max height, if more than 2 in the middle, return false, otherwise return true.
