I will remove all the space first.   

For each iteration, will keep the last symbol if it is + or -, and the last number, and the prefix result.    

For each iteration, if the symbol has a higher priority, pop the last iteration by reversing the operation and the last number.   

Can I assume each number only takes one char?  No.
