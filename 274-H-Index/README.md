NOTE:  Really, really figure out every single piece before you start coding ! ! !  

Looks like sorting, firstly we sort all papers in ascending order, and compare from  last to 1,  check citations[0] and citations.length first.   

This is difficult in that, you will need to understand the relationship first, and figure out how to utilize index as extra space.
